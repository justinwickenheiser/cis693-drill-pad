			<h2>Creating A Show</h2>
			<p>
				First, you will need to login. If you do not have an account, you can <a href="/signup">sign up</a>. After you are logged in, you will see a list of your existing shows. This is where you can create a new show or edit existing shows. Creating or editing shows will open up the Editor.
			</p>

			<a id="Editor"></a>
			<h2>The Editor</h2>
			<p>
				The editor is where the magic happens. The editor is broken into 4 sections:
				<ol>
					<li><em>Field</em>: the grid that represents the marching field</li>
					<li><em>Header Panel</em>: sits above the <em>Field</em></li>
					<li><em>Toolbar</em>: sits to the right of the <em>Field</em> and contains the different <em>Features</em></li>
					<li><em>Control Panel</em>: site below the <em>Field</em> and will be populated with different inputs and controls based on the selected <em>Feature</em></li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h2>Helpers</h2>
			<a id="Helpers"></a>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>Pan / Zoom</h3>
					<p>
						<code>shift + [scroll]</code> over the <em>Field</em> will Pan<br />
						<code>alt + [scroll]</code> over the <em>Field</em> will Zoom<br />
						Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-search"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em> to reset the <em>Field's</em> Pan/Zoom.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>Snap To Grid</h3>
					<p>
						Holding <code>shift</code> will activate "Snap-to-Grid" for the following situations:
						<ul>
							<li>Adding Performers</li>
							<li>Drag / Drop Performers</li>
							<li>Drawing Reference Objects</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h2>Features</h2>
			<a id="EditorSettings"></a>
			<h3>Editor Settings</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-cogs"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Header Panel</em>. This will open a modal that allows you to give the show a title and specify which Hash setting to use. You can switch between College and High School hashes. Changing the Hash setting can be done at any time as it will only re-draw the underlying grid for the field to move the hash lines.
			</p>
			<a id="ChartSettings"></a>
			<h3>Chart Settings</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-cog"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Header Panel</em>. This will open a modal that allows you to give the active chart a title and specify how many counts it will take to move to the next chart. The number of counts cannot be a negative number. Zero counts is an acceptable value. This is because count 0 acts as the initial position of the chart (where the performer should be at the beginning of the chart).
			</p>
			<p>
				Stepping through various counts can be done using the left and right arrow buttons on the right side of the <em>Header Panel</em>. Let's say the active count for the chart is 8 and there are 32 counts to get from the active chart to the next chart. The <em>Header Panel</em> will read <code>Count: 8 / 32</code>. Using that example, a performer's position on the <em>Field</em> can be accurately read as <em>"The Performer will be in this position <strong>after</strong> 8 counts"</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last count of every chart will <strong>always</strong> be the exact same and count 0 of the next chart. If a performer's position is updated on a given chart, the position for the last count of the previous chart is updated to the initial position (count 0) of the active chart, and the initial position (count 0) of the next chart is updated to last count's position of the current chart. These updates happen automatically and behind the scene, but just be aware that it happens.
			</p>

			<a id="AddChart"></a>
			<h3>Add Chart</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[+]</code> button at the top of the toolbar. This will do the following:
				<ol>
					<li>Create a new chart</li>
					<li>Add the chart to the end of the editor's list of charts</li>
					<li>Set the new chart as the active chart</li>
					<li>Call the Chart Settings feature to allow the user to set the Title and Counts</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<a id="AddPerformer"></a>
			<h3>Add Performer</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-user"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em>. Performers can be added in 3 ways:
				<ul>
					<li>Point-and-Click - single performer</li>
					<li>Rectangle - click/drag</li>
					<li>Circle - click/drag</li>
				</ul>
				No matter which method is chosen, a <em>Symbol</em> can be selected to be the label for the Performer. The Symbol will default to the letter 'X'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the Rectangle Shape method for adding performers offers 2 additional inputs: one for the spacing between performers front to back and one for the spacing between performers left to right. The performers will be drawn in using the drawn rectangle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the Circle Shape method provides 1 additional input: the number of performers to add. Draw the circle by clicking on the center of the circle, drag to the desired radius, and release. Performers will be added on release and will populate on the circle equally spaced around the center.
			</p>

			<a id="DrawReference"></a>
			<h3>Draw Reference Objects</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-pencil"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em>. There are 4 types of reference objects.
				<ul>
					<li>Point</li>
					<li>Circle</li>
					<li>Rectangle</li>
					<li>Arc</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the Circle Shape method provides 1 additional input: the number of reference points to add. Draw the circle by clicking on the center of the circle, drag to the desired radius, and release. Reference points will be added on release and will populate on the circle equally spaced around the center.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the Rectangle Shape method offers 2 additional inputs: one for the spacing between reference points front to back and one for the spacing between reference points left to right. The reference points will be drawn in using the drawn rectangle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the Arc Shape method provides 2 additional input: one for the number of performers to add and one to select a reference point to 'arc through'. Draw the arc by clicking on starting position, drag, and release where it should end. If an 'Arc Through Point' is selected, then arc will be drawn in a way that passes through all 3 points. If an 'Arc Through Point' is <em>not</em> selected, then the midpoint between the start and end points with an arbitrary offset. Reference points will be added on release and will populate on the arc equally spaced.
			</p>

			<a id="Pointer"></a>
			<h3>Pointer</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-mouse-pointer"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em>. This feature acts as a way to deselect a different active feature.
			</p>

			<a id="Select"></a>
			<h3>Select</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-object-group"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em>. This acts as a lasso-type-tool. Draw a loop to around performers to select them. Drawing a new select will deselect all selected performers first.
			</p>
			<p>
				Performers can also be selected individually by <code>Command + Click</code> (on Mac) or <code>Windows + Click</code> (on Windows). Performers can also be selected and deselected through the <em>Manage Performers</em> Feature (<code>[<span class="fa fa-users"></span>]</code>).
			</p>

			<a id="MovePerformer"></a>
			<h3>Move Performer</h3>
			<p>
				The <em>Move Performer</em> Feature requires at least one performer be selected. With at least one performer selected, click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-male"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em>. This feature allows applying a set of <em>Standard Moves</em> to the selected performers in the form of <code>Instructions</code> and <code>Patterns</code>. The instructions/moves are applied based on the performers' position in the currently active chart.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first input is the total number of counts that will be applied. From there, any number of <code>Patterns</code> can be added. A <code>Pattern</code> is simply a list of <code>Instructions</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Instructions</strong><br />
				An <code>Instruction</code> consists of a <em>Type of Movement</em>, <em>Step Size</em>, and <em>Number of Counts</em>. An <code>Instruction</code> can be interpreted as "Apply this <em>Type of Movement</em> using this <em>Step Size</em> for this <em>Number of Counts</em>".
				<br />
				<strong>Example:</strong> "Forward March (FM) 8 to 5 for 16 counts"
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Types of Movements</strong><br />
				<ul>
					<li>Forward March (FM)</li>
					<li>Backward March (BM)</li>
					<li>Left Traverse (LT)</li>
					<li>Right Traverse (RT)</li>
					<li>Mark Time (MT)</li>
					<li>Oblique Left</li>
					<li>Oblique Right</li>
					<li>Backward Oblique Left</li>
					<li>Backward Oblique Right</li>
				</ul>
				<em>Note: Movement directions are from the performers's perspective.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Patterns</strong><br />
				A <code>Pattern</code> is simply a list of <code>Instructions</code> that can be applied one or more times. The number of times a <code>Pattern</code> is applied depends one if there is a <code>Reference Point</code> that is provided. If a <code>Reference Point</code> <strong>is not</strong> provided, the <code>Pattern</code> will be applied only <em>once</em> before moving to the next <code>Pattern</code>. If a <code>Reference Point</code> <strong>is</strong> provided, the <code>Pattern</code> will applied as many times as it takes until the performer hits the <code>Reference Point</code> before moving to the next <code>Pattern</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Checking for Reference Point</strong><br />
				The check to see if the performer hits the <code>Reference Point</code> happens prior to applying the <code>Pattern</code>. Then, the whole <code>Pattern</code> is applied before checking for the <code>Reference Point</code> again.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The Final Instruction</strong><br />
				This instruction will be applied after all patterns are completed for the remaining number of counts.
			</p>

			<a id="RotatePerformer"></a>
			<h3>Rotate Performer</h3>
			<p>
				The <em>Rotate Performer</em> Feature requires at least one performer be selected. With at least one performer selected, click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-rotate-right"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em>. Rotate a certain number of degrees over the given number of counts around the specified reference point.
			</p>

			<a id="ViewAnimation"></a>
			<h3>View Animation</h3>
			<p>
				Click the <code>[<span class="fa fa-play"></span>]</code> button in the <em>Toolbar</em>. There are dropdowns to select the starting and ending charts. There is a play/pause button to control the animation. Finally there is a set of speed controls to decrease or increase the playback speed.
			</p>
