        <h3>This is your freshly-generated project + a few extras.</h3>
        <p>In our time <a target="_blank" href="https://sailsjs.com/about">building apps for customers</a>, we've found ourselves re-rolling some of the same key features over and over again between projects.  So we picked some of the things that kept popping up, implemented our own opinionated solutions for them, and then included it all in this free and open-source starter app.  We hope it helps you as much as it helps us!</p>

      <h3>Let's get to work.</h3>
      <p>We think this project is a pretty convenient starting point, but of course there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The good news is, this app is in your hands now, so you can jump into the files and adapt it to your needs. Change some code around. Break stuff.  Fix it. And above all: <strong>make something people want to use</strong>.</p>
